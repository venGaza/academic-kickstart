It has been a long time coming for me to take the time to create a personal portfolio page. I have been putting this off for years because I was so focused on finding the "perfect" layout but I have finally come to the conclusion this does not exist! It was time to just take a leap of faith and dive into completing the project. 

Why did I want to build this though? I have been using my Github repository as a makeshift portfolio and to be honest, it is not all that inspiring to share with others. Even with a fantastic README.md, Github is just plain boring to peruse. I needed a better way to show off my projects and accomplishments. I needed to create a portfolio that people wanted to explore and make it easy for them to learn about me. I also figured this could be an opportunity to share a piece of myself with the world. A chance to share the knowledge I have come across from studying, reading, and building. Who knows, maybe this will inspire someone else...
