## Task 2 - Permissions - [Getting Started - Part 2] - (Mobile APK Analysis)

The TerrorTime APK file contains metadata that describes various security properties of the application that we want to know. Since we now have a copy of the APK thanks to the military operation described in Task 1, we need you to identify and submit the following:

App Permissions
The SHA256 hash of the Code Signing Certificate
The Common Name of the Certificate Signer

Please note that completion of task 1 is required to complete this task.
