## Turn of Events
Category: Database Analysis

Analysts found TerrorTime installed on a device that was taken from a terrorist arrested at a port of entry in the US. They were able to recover the SQLite database from the TerrorTime installation on the device, which should provide us with more in-depth knowledge about the terrorist's communications and the TerrorTime infrastructure. Your goal for this task is to analyze the database and submit the addresses of the TerrorTime OAUTH (authentication) and XMPP (chat) servers.

### Flags
- [ ] OAUTH IP Address
- [ ] XMPP Server IP Address

[Task Files](https://codebreaker.ltsnet.net/files/task3/clientDB.db?1593563870)

## Solution

### Commands
- `dig` - Domain Information Groper, a DNS lookup utility
- `host` - A utility to perform DNS lookups (Optional)
- `nslookup` - Performs DNS queries (Optional)
- `ping` - Send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts (Optional)

### Tools
- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) - Create, search and edit databases

### Analysis
In this challenge, we are presented with an SQLite database file and tasked with finding the IP (network) addresses of the OAUTH and XMPP servers. What is SQLite, OAUTH, and XMPP? 

>  SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world.
>
> -- <cite>https://www.sqlite.org/index.html</cite>

>  OAUTH is an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.
>
> -- <cite>https://oauth.net/</cite>

>  XMPP is the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, a set of open technologies for instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data.

What separates SQLite from other relational databases management systems (RDBMS) is it embeds itself with the program rather than relying on a client-server model. This means no additional server is needed to run and manage this database. We will use a special tool to open the `clientDB.db` file and one of my favorite is <mark>DB Browser for SQLite</mark>. Open up the file and go to the `BROWSE DATA` tab.

This database has 3 tables: clients, contacts, and messages. The contacts and messages tables have no data, so we'll focus on the clients table which has 1 row of input. The row has plenty of attribute columns, but there are two that stand out, the `xsip` and `asip`. These columns possess what seems to be domain names for our potential server targets.

We can now use these domain names to perform a DNS lookup to determine the IP addresses by using the `dig` command on each of them in the terminal.

$ dig register.terrortime.app

Tip: Other command line binaries exist to perform a DNS lookup such as `host`, `nslookup`, and `ping`. Try them out and see how the output differs from `dig`.
