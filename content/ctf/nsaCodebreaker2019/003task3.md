## Turn of Events (Database Analysis)

Analysts found TerrorTime installed on a device that was taken from a terrorist arrested at a port of entry in the US. They were able to recover the SQLite database from the TerrorTime installation on the device, which should provide us with more in-depth knowledge about the terrorist's communications and the TerrorTime infrastructure. Your goal for this task is to analyze the database and submit the addresses of the TerrorTime OAUTH (authentication) and XMPP (chat) servers.

### Flags
- [ ] OAUTH IP Address
- [ ] XMPP Server IP Address
